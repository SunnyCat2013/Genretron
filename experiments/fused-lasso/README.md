# Experiments for the thesis

## Goals

Understand the effect of Fused Lasso on:

* MNIST
* GTZAN
* Softmax Regression
* Convolutional Neural Networks
* L2
* L1
* Alone

Therefore, we need the following experiments:

## Experiments

1. Standard MNIST model, softmax regression. Establish a baseline. Make 5 runs with different seeds.
2. MNIST with horizontal FL, softmax. See what is the effect of FL on the weights. Multiple experiments with different fl lambdas, consult the already done experiments to see how many.. 1 experiment per model should be enough.
3. MNIST with vertical FL, softmax. See what is the effect of FL on the weights. Multiple experiments with different FL lambdas, consult the already done experiments to see how many.. 1 experiment per model should be enough.
4. MNIST with 2d FL, softmax. See what is the effect of FL on the weights. Multiple experiments with different FL lambdas, consult the already done experiments to see how many. 1 experiment per model should be enough.

5. Standard MNIST, convolutional neural networks. Establish a baseline. Make 5 runs with different seeds.
6. MNIST with horizontal FL, convolutional neural networks. See what is the effect of FL on the weights. Multiple experiments with different fl lambdas, consult the already done experiments to see how many.. 1 experiment per model should be enough.
7. MNIST with vertical FL, convolutional neural networks. See what is the effect of FL on the weights. Multiple experiments with different FL lambdas, consult the already done experiments to see how many.. 1 experiment per model should be enough.
